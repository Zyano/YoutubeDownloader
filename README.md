This repo is used for suggestions for the youtube playlist service.
Suggestions for features can be requested by creating an issue.
Bugs can be reported the same way features are requested.

## Source code availability 
I currently don't have a time frame on a possible release of the source code behind the web application.


## Currently being worked on
* Login system foreach user in an effort to support private playlists rather than hidden and public.
* Complete remake to the way conversion is handled in order to allow custom format.
* Behinds the scenes redesign of the converter library inorder to support a more natural flow of DB related tasks.

## Far in the future
I would love to hear feedback and ideas in this section. These are mostly things I personally think could be "nice" to have. There for I don't consider them a high priority.
* Better randomize function for the web player.
* Internal playlists for the site it self.
* Support for video downloading as well.
* Youtube search and download directly from the site.
* Support for passing the entire youtube url to the converter - remove the need to give a specific videoId or playlistId.
